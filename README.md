# Anonynoob

This is a data analysis exercise I decided to do after hearing the "nothing to hide" theory for Dota 2 player's data. I'm playing the devil's advocate and trying to prove that theory using publicly available data on [www.dotabuff.com](http://www.dotabuff.com/) (sorry for the heavy scraping guys!).


## Theory

"Nothing to hide": anonymous players negatively impact the performance of their team
Meaning: if a team has a higher number of anonymous players, its odds to win are lower

## Learnings so far

1. Anonymous players are the majority of players
2. Overall they do not affect a match result

** But I need more data to test the advanced theory: a big disparity in anonymous players between the teams will negatively impact the match outcome.**

## Stuff to test

- Straightforward global test
- Amount of difference in anonymous players to make an impact
- Whether the high number of anonymous players in a game makes the outcome hard to predict

## Expected results

- Overall anonymous have very low impact
- There will be a sweet spot where they have a significant impact, ex: the 3 anonymous players are all in one team

## Why am I doing this?

- Prove that anonymous players are not intrinsically bad: many valid reasons to be anonymous other than hiding your poor performance
- Prove that a bad repartition of anonymous players can skew the results of the game, thus proving the need of balancing the amount of anonymous players via matchmaking (maybe a recommendation for Valve)
